Project Title: Tictactoe Game
Project Description: Standalone game allows user to beat AI.
  The winner is defined that has a cross
  of row, column, or diagonal. This game
  is designed with a smart AI to challenge
  players like you!
  This project includes main files of matrix
  operators, tictactoe game driver, and main
  file to call driver and load the game.
